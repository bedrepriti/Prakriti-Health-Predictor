# Individual-Prakriti  
### ML-Powered Disease Prediction & Healthcare Recommendation System

Individual-Prakriti is a machine-learning–based healthcare web application that predicts possible diseases based on user-entered symptoms and provides supportive medical insights.  
The project demonstrates the practical use of **machine learning models integrated with a Flask web application**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The system allows users to:
- Enter symptoms through a web interface
- Predict potential diseases using trained ML models
- View suggested medications and precautions
- Locate nearby healthcare facilities
- Generate downloadable PDF prescriptions for reference

This project focuses on **applying ML models in a real-world healthcare workflow**, not just model training.
